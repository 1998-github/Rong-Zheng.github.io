I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Teaching, Learning & Culture](http://tlac.tamu.edu/), [Texas A&M University](http://www.tamu.edu/). My research interest is to build education applications to help learners learn well, and to model educational data for understanding learnersâ€™ learning status clearly, by utilizing methods in natural language processing and machine learning techniques.
