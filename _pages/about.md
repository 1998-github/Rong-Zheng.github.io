I am a postdoctoral fellow at [Teaching, Learning & Culture](http://tlac.tamu.edu/), [Texas A&M University](http://www.tamu.edu/). My research interest is to build education applications to help learners learn well, and to model educational data for understanding learners’ learning status clearly, by utilizing methods in natural language processing and machine learning techniques. My Ph.D. work, for example, focused on developing computational algorithms to automatically generate personalized multiple-choice questions, using statistical approaches to assess readability of a reading material, and utilizing qualitative methodologies to identify a learner’s current proficiency level, in order to help learners with different abilities to practice adaptive exercises with appropriate difficulties and to give them the opportunity to repeatedly clarify unclear concepts.

I currently work with Prof. [Noboru Matsuda](http://people.tamu.edu/~mazda/) and Prof. [Ruihong Huang](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/huangrh/). Previously, I was an assistant research fellow in Research Center for Testing and Assessment, [National Academy for Educational Research](http://www.naer.edu.tw/bin/home.php), Taiwan. I was a visiting scholar at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu/), where I was hosted by Prof. [Jack Mostow](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./mostow/).
