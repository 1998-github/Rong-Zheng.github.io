Hello, my name is Jinghai Huo (霍静海).I am a graduate student of [Southwest Jiaotong University] (https://www.swjtu.edu.cn/), where I am advised by Professor [Hongtai Yang]( https://faculty.swjtu.edu.cn/yanghongtai/zh_CN/index.htm).
I graduated with a B.S. in Transportation Engineering from Southwest Jiaotong University, China, in 2019. I am currently working on applying data science (e.g., data analytics and machine learning) on shared mobility research. 

In my free time I like to read, play tennis, and eat any type of new food I can get my hands on.
