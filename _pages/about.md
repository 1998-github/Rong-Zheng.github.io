Previously, I was an assistant research fellow in Research Center for Testing and Assessment, [National Academy for Educational Research](http://www.naer.edu.tw/bin/home.php), Taiwan. I was a visiting scholar at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu/), where I was hosted by Prof. [Jack Mostow](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./mostow/).
